# XtSCI-scRNAseq
Single cell RNA seq analysis of Xenopus tadpole spinal cord during regrowth after amputation

I analysed scRNAseq data from Xenopus tadpole spinal cord samples 0, 1, 3 and 5 days post amputation to gain insight into transcriptional signatures and cell type differentiation trajectories involved in regeneration of the spinal cord. Techniques I used include differential expression analysis, principle component analysis, uniform manifold approximation and projection. This was primarily done through R programming using the Seurat and Monocle packages. I also used the OscoNet tool to identify potentially oscillating gene networks.
